Description: Optimal experimental designs for functional linear and functional generalised linear models, for scalar responses and profile/dynamic factors. The designs are optimised using the coordinate exchange algorithm. The methods are discussed by Michaelides (2023) <https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/474982/1/Thesis_DamianosMichaelides_Final_pdfa_1_.pdf>.
